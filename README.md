# Ford_Fulkerson_Algorithm 
  
## Repository contains implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in Python. Created for Graph Theory classes.  
  
### Description:
The implementation consists of two files:
- **adjacency_matrix.txt**
- **main.py**
#### Input:
Input is given in file **adjacency_matrix.txt**. Lines (separated by '\n' sign) represents vertices in ascending order, each line contains numbers that are separated by ',' that represents weight of directed edge between specified vertices.
#### E. G.
For a directed graph:

Adjacency matrix should look like:
